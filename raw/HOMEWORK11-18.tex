\noindent 1. Show that a finite group $G$ is abelian if and only if its irreducible representations all have degree 1.
\vskip .5in
\noindent 2. Construct the character tables of the group $G$ of quaternion units and the dihedral group $H$ of order 8 and verify that they are the same.
\vskip .5in
\noindent 3. The purpose of the remaining three problems is to show that any two nonabelian groups of order $p^3, p$ a prime, have identical character tables.  Let $G$ be a nonabelian group of order $p^3$.  Show that its center $Z$ is cyclic of order $p$ (say generated by $z$) and that
$G/Z$ is isomorphic to the direct product $\Bbb Z_p\times\Bbb Z_p$. Also show that $G$ has $p$ conjugacy classes of size 1 and $p^2 - 1$ such classes of size $p$, so $p^2 + p -1$ conjugacy classes altogether.
\vskip .5in
\noindent 4. Deduce that $G$ has $p^2$ distinct representations of degree 1, on each of which $Z$ acts trivially.  Show that the conjugacy class of any $g\in G$ with $g\notin Z$ takes the form
$\{g,gz,\ldots,gz^{p-1}\}$.  
\vskip .5in
\noindent 5. In each of the remaining irreducible representations of $G$, the generator $z$ of $Z$ acts by a complex $p$-th root of 1 different from 1 itself.  Deduce that there are $p-1$ such representations, each of degree $p$.  Show that the character of each of them on any $g\notin Z$ equals 0.  Work out the character table of $G$ from this and observe that it does not depend on the structure of $G$ (apart from $G$ being nonabelian).
