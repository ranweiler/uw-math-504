\noindent Problems 10.5.1,2 and 17.1.1,3 in Dummit and Foote, and the following:  given projective resolutions $\{P_i\},\{Q_i\}$ with boundary maps $d_i,d_i'$ of left $R$-modules $M,N$, the 0 map from $M$ to $N$, and maps $f_i$ from $P_i$ to $Q_i$ making the obvious diagram (in class) commute, show that there are maps $s_i:P_i\rightarrow Q_{i+1}$ such that $d_1' s_0 = f_0,
d_{i+1}' s_i + s_{i-1} d_i = f_i$ for $i\ge1$.
